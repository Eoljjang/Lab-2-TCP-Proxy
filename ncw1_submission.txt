Question 1: By specifing the second argument to be -> socket.socket(..., socket.SOCK_STREAM)

Question 2: The client socket intializes the connection, while the server socket listens for a connection. The client makes requests, and the server gives responses.

Question 3: You can reuse the same bind port by setting the socket option (s.setsockopt) to socket.SO_REUSEADDR and giving it a value of 1.

Question 4: We receive the address (IP) of the client (127.01.01.1 in this case) and the port of the client.

Question 5: After the client is done sending the HTTP request, the server closes the connection and returns an empty byte string (client stops accepting data).
